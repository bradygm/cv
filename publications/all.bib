    abstract={
      Autonomous indoor exploration is a crucial task for mobile robots, especially in search and rescue and inspection scenarios. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted heuristics that may not generalize well across different environments. In this work, we propose MapExRL, a novel framework that combines predicted environment context with reinforcement learning to enable efficient and adaptive indoor exploration. Our method leverages a deep neural network to predict the context of the environment, such as room types and connectivity, which is then used to inform the exploration strategy learned through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach in simulated indoor environments and demonstrate that MapExRL outperforms traditional exploration methods in terms of coverage efficiency and adaptability to diverse layouts. Our results suggest that incorporating predicted environment context can significantly enhance the performance of autonomous indoor exploration systems.
