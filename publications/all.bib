    abstract={
      Autonomous indoor exploration is a crucial task for mobile robots, especially in search and rescue and inspection scenarios. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted heuristics that may not generalize well across different environments. In this work, we propose MapExRL, a novel framework that combines predicted environment context with reinforcement learning to enable efficient and adaptive indoor exploration. Our method leverages a deep neural network to predict the context of the environment, such as room types and connectivity, which is then used to inform the exploration strategy learned through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach in simulated indoor environments and demonstrate that MapExRL outperforms traditional exploration methods in terms of coverage efficiency and adaptability to diverse layouts. Our results suggest that incorporating predicted environment context can significantly enhance the performance of autonomous indoor exploration systems.

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can collaborate as teams to accomplish diverse mission objectives, such as target search and tracking. This paper introduces a method that leverages accumulated target-density information over the course of a UAV mission to adapt path-planning rewards, guiding UAVs toward areas with a higher likelihood of target presence. The target density is modeled using a Gaussian process, which is iteratively updated as the UAVs search the environment. Unlike conventional search algorithms that prioritize unexplored regions, this approach incentivizes revisiting target-rich areas. The target-density information is shared across UAVs using decentralized consensus filters, enabling cooperative path selection that balances the exploration of uncertain regions with the exploitation of known high-density areas. The framework presented in this paper provides an adaptive cooperative search method that can quickly develop an understanding of the region’s target-dense areas, helping UAVs refine their search. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate this method in both a 2D grid region and road networks, showing up to a 26% improvement in target density estimates.},
